In normal dev mode when You load page then all the pages in your app will get load.
using lazy loading we can prevent this. 
Wen will onl get the current page and other will not be loaded at that time.
this increase the effeciency

This is called code splitting

This is how we can do lazy routing


const routes = [
    {
        path: '/',
        name: 'Home',
        component: Home
    },
    {
        path: '/about',
        name: 'About',
        component: ()=>import('../views/About.vue')
    },
    {
        path: '/brazil',
        name: 'Brazil',
        component: ()=>import('../views/Brazil.vue')
    },
    {
        path: '/hawaii',
        name: 'Hawaii',
        component: ()=>import('../views/Hawaii.vue')
    },
    {
        path: '/jamaica',
        name: 'Jamaica',
        component: ()=>import('../views/Jamaica.vue')
    },
    {
        path: '/panama',
        name: 'Panama',
        component: ()=>import('../views/Panama.vue')
    },
]


Now code is split into chunks, when we do npm run build the for each page you will see seprate js file

In normal CLI app we can use magic comment to name the chunks like this

{
        path: '/panama',
        name: 'Panama',
        component: ()=>import(/*webpackChunkName : "panama"'../views/Panama.vue')
    },
