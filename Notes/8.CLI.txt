If we want to make complete VueJs frontend then we can use cli.js
I will use VITE

npm create vite@latest 
choose vue---> javascript.


File & Folder Structure ->
1. package.json ---------> all the dependencies we will install.
2. If we use vite then, vite.configjs file (bable.config.js) -> use to convert your morden js into js which can be understand by browser
3. index.html
This is only html file we have which will contain one div with id = app and our whole code will come inside it.


4. public contian only one svg
5. main folder is source(src)
This folder contain main.js in which we will createApp(App) and mount our vue in #app id


App.vue is the parent of all the components and pages. here all the code will start.
components folder will contain all the components.
assets will have all the assets


Additional we will make -> pages folder, util folder, lib folder for more functionality
