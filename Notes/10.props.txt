In vue js we can have props inside the 


<script>
export default {
    name : 'Icon',
    props : {
        iconName : {
            type : String,
            required : true,
        }
    }

}
</script>

Like this and we can define the validations in it also.

Props are same as react, which is used to hold some information, and this are immutable.
we can pass data from one component to other using props
